Hi! I'm [Antoine Catton](https://antoine.catton.fr/) (pronounced in english
*Ant-waan Kei-ton*). I'm currently a Google Employee, Site Reliability
Engineer, Software Engineer, System Engineer.

This is my github profile, but that's not where all my projects are. Some of my projects are also hosted on:

 * My own website: <https://antoine.catton.fr/en/projects/>
 * Gitlab: <https://gitlab.com/acatton>

I sometimes fork repositories to contribute (for example I submitted fixes to
[htop](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/pull/319),
[gotham-rs](https://github.com/gotham-rs/gotham/pull/349), and
[hundreds of other pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aacatton+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed))

I used to be really involved in Python. But, these days, I mostly code in Golang, Rust and OCaml.

My successful python projects included:

* [flatbencode](https://github.com/acatton/flatbencode): a serializer/deserializer for bencoding, which doesn't use recursion.
* [ohneio](https://github.com/acatton/ohneio): a [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) library for Python 3.5+.

When I studied in university I worked on
[superaes](https://github.com/acatton/superaes) which was an AES-based
encryption algorithm with double the key size and S-boxes size.
